# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and the project uses semantic-ish versioning: minor bumps per completed
modernization sprint (or batch), patch bumps for hotfixes. Each released
version gets a matching GitHub release and git tag.

## [Unreleased]

- Sprint 8 (PR #13): MCP server module — manage targets and query latency
  data conversationally from Claude Code / Claude Desktop.
- Sprint 9: AI insights & in-UI assistant.
  - New `shared/modules/ai-insights/` service: pulls latency/loss/microcut
    aggregates from InfluxDB and writes plain-language Markdown health
    reports via Claude (Haiku by default; `AI_MODEL` overridable). Guardrails:
    input-size cap, `AI_REPORTS_PER_DAY` cap, clean no-op when
    `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is unset. Compose snippet documented in
    `docs/ai-insights.md` (compose/editions files owned by an in-flight PR).
  - web-admin: new AI section — `/ai/reports` renders the generated reports
    (tiny built-in safe Markdown renderer, empty-state help when disabled)
    and `/ai/chat` is an assistant that reuses the MCP tool surface
    (stats read tools run inline; add/remove/toggle target require an
    explicit confirmation card before executing). No `apply_config` tool —
    regeneration is automatic.

## [2.2.0] — 2026-07-30

Web-admin hardening and UX overhaul (Sprints 4–5).

### Security (PR #14)
- Password-hash auth (`WEB_ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH`) with constant-time
  plaintext fallback; no hardcoded default credentials; `SECRET_KEY`
  required; CSRF protection on every state-changing request; per-IP
  login lockout; open-redirect fix; Cloudflare token out of URL query.
- Single authenticated data path: web-admin only talks to the
  config-manager API (Bearer token); YAML fallback dual-writes and the
  silently-broken dashboard delete removed; Docker socket removed from
  web-admin entirely; scheduler runs exactly once.
- API token auth active end-to-end on the Pro deployment.

### UX (PR #16)
- Bootstrap + icons vendored locally — the UI works during the exact
  internet outages it exists to diagnose.
- Toast/confirm/fetch helpers replace all alert()/confirm() dialogs.
- Targets: search, category/status filters, inactive targets visible
  with activate toggle, edit dialog, bulk delete, CSV export.
- Add-target: identical client/server name validation, inline errors,
  IPv6-aware hostname checks, auto-regeneration feedback.
- Dashboard: full target lists with per-target SmokePing and Grafana
  links; shows Database/YAML mode.
- Top Sites: loading-modal deadlock fixed, honest selection counters,
  review-before-update, real CrUX per-country lists; broken countries
  page removed.

## [2.1.0] — 2026-07-29

Modernization phase 1 (Sprints 1–3, 6 + CI). PostgreSQL becomes the real
source of truth and the Grafana/exporter pipeline is made trustworthy.

### Added
- **CPE microcut detection** (PR #7): hourly traceroute discovery of the
  ISP CPE (IPv4+IPv6), 5 pps windowed probing, `cpe_latency` measurement
  in InfluxDB, and a dedicated Grafana dashboard.
- **CI pipeline** (PRs #8, #9): ruff critical rules, per-edition
  `docker compose config` validation (incl. ClickHouse overlay), shell
  syntax checks, Grafana dashboard/provisioning validation with
  duplicate-uid detection, auto-discovered per-module pytest suites, and
  Docker image build checks.
- **API auth** (PR #10): optional shared-token auth on the config-manager
  API (`CONFIG_API_TOKEN`, Bearer / X-API-Token).
- First real test suites: config-manager (32), smokeping-exporters (30).

### Changed
- **PostgreSQL activated as the configuration source of truth** (PR #10):
  idempotent YAML→DB migration runs at startup; YAML becomes
  import/export. Config generation is atomic, file-locked, in-process
  (the subprocess fork-chain "zombie generator" is gone), and fully
  data-driven (hardcoded big-name template blocks removed). Gunicorn
  replaces the Flask dev server. FPing6 seeded (fixes IPv6 target 500s).
- **Grafana overhaul** (PR #11): single dashboard provider
  (`foldersFromFilesStructure`), dashboards organized into folders,
  entrypoint rewritten with proper signal handling (`exec`), Dockerfile
  HEALTHCHECK, dead `$status` variable and user-specific exclusions
  removed, CPE microcut dashboard finished (target variable, thresholds,
  proper panel options).
- **Exporter rewrite** (PR #11): `rrd2influx.py` now fetches incrementally
  since the last exported timestamp with downtime backfill (≤24h) and
  writes **loss as a ratio 0–1** (was a raw lost-ping count that rendered
  1 lost ping as 100%). Historical points keep the old scale.

### Fixed
- **6-week outage root cause** (PR #7): no `restart:` policy on any core
  Pro service — a reboot left the whole stack down. All services now
  `restart: unless-stopped`.
- **All 8 InfluxDB dashboards rendered empty** (PR #7): queries targeted
  bucket `latency`; the deployment writes to `smokeping` (67 refs fixed).
- Atomic writes preserved root ownership on host bind mounts, breaking
  git and host tooling (PR #12); DB reads had no `order_by`, making
  generated config nondeterministic (PR #12).
- Env template drift (PR #8): `TIMEZONE`→`TZ` (timezone config was a
  silent no-op in basic/standard), wrong `POSTGRES_DB` in standard.

### Removed
- ~2,300 lines of committed runtime artifacts (PR #8): YAML backups,
  `cookies.txt`, OCA dumps, orphaned modules (`api_docs.py`, stub
  compose file, broken test scripts). Backup retention added so they
  cannot accumulate again.

### Deprecated
- ClickHouse support marked experimental/unmaintained (parked; known
  datasource-plugin and schema mismatches documented in README).

## [2.0.0] — historical

Pre-modernization state: three Docker editions (Basic/Standard/Pro),
config-manager + web-admin + Grafana/InfluxDB stack as of PR #6.
